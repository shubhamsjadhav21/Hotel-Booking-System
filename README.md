# Project Description
A hotel Booking System is the mechanism through which guests can create secure online hotel booking. While the process is similar to booking with an online travel agent (OTA), the difference is the hotel’s booking engine essentially links up to their own website so that there are no additional fees incurred for the property. 

The booking management software essentially automates the booking process, syncing up with your hotel’s website and social media so that guests can reserve easily and conveniently without having to visit another site. The reservation system can also link up to the channel manager, allowing hotels to distribute their availability to both online agents in real time.

This type of software is key to having global appeal and to increased occupancy rates. It’s an essential tool to increase bookings, create enhanced guest experiences, leading to higher customer retention and increased revenue.
